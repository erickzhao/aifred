As a Researcher for aifred’s Research team, Colleen is investigating predictors for antidepressant treatment response in major depressive disorder. She recently completed a BSc in Neuroscience at McGill University, during which she became involved in research ranging from auditory brain plasticity, to modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease, to computational genetics, to social factors influencing the etiology of schizophrenia, with a particular interest in using computational tools to characterize alterations in neuroanatomy related to different disorders of the brain. In October 2017, Colleen will begin a PhD in Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge as a Gates Cambridge Scholar. Her research there will focus on exploring the neural basis of hallucinations in schizophrenia. Ultimately, her overarching goal is to translate research findings into clinical practice to make tangible improvements in patient care.

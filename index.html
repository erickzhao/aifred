                Depression is a common, serious mental illness, that affects more than 300 million people globally 1.
                Some patients can spend years finding the right choice for them, and many patients won’t improve after the 
                first treatment 2. The inability to predict any given individual’s heterogeneous response to medical treatment 
                is arguably one of the biggest bottlenecks to mental health recovery. The aifred solution will be a tool acting 
                as a trusted advisor for healthcare professionals to optimize treatment quality and efficacy in psychiatry. 
                Initially, we will be focusing on treatments for depression, but we plan to scale this tool to encompass all 
                mental health conditions in order to amplify clinical utility. At its core, aifred is leveraging the collective 
                intelligence of the scientific and medical community to bring better healthcare to everyone.

                Aifred acknowledges patient diversity and brings highly tailored treatments to each individual, creating an avenue 
                for doctors to apply personalized, evidence-based medicine in its most rigorous form. Aifred will learn to predict 
                the optimal treatment cocktail for any given patient, while minimizing adverse effects and filtering out safety concerns 
                such drug-disease or drug-drug interactions. This in turn will lead to faster recovery or/and remission, while 
                reducing the potential dangers that arise due to delayed treatment response, such as suicide.  With better treatment 
                effectiveness and side-effect prediction, personalized treatments can be chosen faster, saving on costs, limiting 
                suffering, and empowering physicians and their patients.

                The aifred solution is a clinical decision aid system built with machine learning techniques, aimed at helping 
                clinicians choose the most effective treatments for mental health problems, given individual patient characteristics, 
                in order to reduce time to remission of symptoms as much as possible while minimizing adverse side effects. By 
                training our model on large datasets, which include information about socio-demographic factors, symptom profiles, 
                as well as genetic, metabolic, endocrine, immune, and neuroimaging data, aifred will learn to predict the optimal 
                treatment cocktail for any given patient, with the patient outcomes feeding back into aifred’s database to improve 
                its predictive power.

                As a valuable resource for medical professionals, aifred has potential to be a fundamental step forward in an area 
                desperately in need of innovation, with massive implications for future development and refinement as well. Artificial 
                intelligence provides uncontested potential to integrate data analysis and healthcare, creating the ultimate network to 
                fight mental illness based on the work of doctors, researchers and patients themselves. By forming connections between 
                diverse experts in the field of mental health, aifred itself has innate long term relevancy and answers the call for 
                action in addressing the issue of mental health treatment.

                For a patient with depression, trying a new treatment means several weeks of therapy or medication titration to start 
                seeing if there is a positive effect. This is time lost in the patient’s life - time that is potentially away from work 
                and time when they are not able to be fully present in their families’ lives. This is where aifred comes in. The aifred 
                solution is comprehensive, evidence-based tool for healthcare professionals to assist in rapidly selecting the most 
                effective treatments for any given patient, as early on in their clinical course as possible, in order to reduce time 
                to remission of symptoms as much as possible while minimizing burdensome side effects.

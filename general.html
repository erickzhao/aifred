							Our tech team includes experienced machine learning engineers and researchers from McGill University and the Montreal Neurological Institute. We are constantly prototyping and refining newly published techniques to maintain state-of-the-art methods. Something unique to every machine learning company is the precise nature of their hyperparameter optimization and goals of their model. We will optimize aifred with the help of a distributed network of domain experts in psychiatry--a collaboration unique to aifred health. We are implementing attention networks responsible for removing the “black-box” nature of neural networks. As well, we are analysing the quality of model predictions, allowing both for greater interpretability of model decisions and the generation of new basic research questions, which are going to be unique to the data-set and optimization techniques we develop in-house. By training aifred on reliable datasets, we are able to ensure quality input to our model. De-identified patient outcomes will feed back into our neural networks to continuously improve aifred’s predictive power. Feature engineering is an important part of determining which inputs go into a network and varies how it’s done for every team- once again, this will be undertaken with the support of diverse group of experts we are recruiting. We believe we have the tools in place to get the most out of the data.

The aifred solution is a clinical decision tool designed to help physicians create personalized treatment plans for their patients, with the goal of reducing time to remission while minimizing adverse side effects. Our research team is conducting a series of systematic literature reviews on predictors of treatment response and side effect burden in depression. The results of these reviews will serve to inform a priori hypotheses for our machine learning model and will also help us to assess which biomarker tests can be most easily implemented into routine clinical practice. Overall, the knowledge extracted from parsing relevant scientific literature will serve to validate the relationships outputted by our model, ensuring a robust solution.

							Researchers have estimated that approximately one third of individuals suffering from depression do not recover following treatment (1). Clinical research is focused on validating our model in controlled and real-world conditions. Firstly, the model must be user-friendly and provide clinicians with features they want and need. We must study the aifred solution’s integration into clinical workflow and any effects on clinician efficiency and doctor-patient interaction. Next the efficacy and effectiveness of the model must be assessed in open-label trials and against existing guidelines through randomized control trials. We are blazing the trail when it comes to clinical validation of deep-learning based clinical decision aids, and as such are investing heavily in the development of ethical principles to guide development and testing.
